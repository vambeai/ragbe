# regex stage upstream has already fixed the easy artifacts, so anything
# remaining is either a hard problem (OCR, fragmented sentences) or
# already-correct prose the LLM should leave alone.  Over-correction is
# the bigger risk than under-correction at this point in the pipeline.
#
# Two variants because the user message can arrive with or without a
# ``<<<DOCUMENT SUMMARY>>>`` block:
#
#   ``_PIECE_SYSTEM``               — no summary attached; the prompt
