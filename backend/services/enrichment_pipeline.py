"""
Orchestrator for the markdown enrichment pipeline.

Composes the four stages defined in the design:

    1. ``backend.utils.markdown.clean_markdown`` — deterministic regex pass.
    2. ``backend.utils.markdown.split_markdown`` — structure-aware split.
    3. ``EnrichmentService.enrich_piece`` — conservative LLM correction
       per piece, with rolling context from the *original* (pre-LLM)
       text and per-piece checkpointing.
    4. Reassemble corrected pieces in order.

The whole pipeline runs concurrently (up to ``concurrency`` pieces in
flight at once).  Cancellation is respected at every await point.
Per-piece failures are surfaced via the progress callback but never
abort the entire run: failed pieces fall back to the original
post-cleanup text, the way Phase 1's VLM converter falls back to a
placeholder.  The caller decides whether to retry.

Why piece-level checkpointing here:
    A 200-piece enrichment is 200 LLM calls.  Re-running after a network
    blip without resuming would waste anywhere from minutes to hours.
    The checkpoint key (see ``enrichment_checkpoint.hash_key``) covers
    every input that determines a piece's output, so reusing the cache
    is always safe — and unchanged inputs after a parameter tweak (e.g.
    user retries with the same prompt+model) become essentially free.

    Args:
        source_markdown:        Raw markdown to enrich.
        service:                Pre-configured LLM client.  The pipeline
                                derives ``model`` / ``user_prompt`` from
                                its internals to compute checkpoint
                                hashes.
        checkpoint_store:       Optional store.  When provided, completed
                                pieces are persisted and re-runs reuse
                                them whenever hashes match.  Pass ``None``
                                to disable caching (e.g. trial runs).
        document_summary:       Optional pre-built reference summary
                                (see :mod:`document_summary`).  When
                                provided and non-empty, its prompt block
                                is attached to every piece correction
                                AND its content hash is mixed into the
                                per-piece cache key so a different
                                summary cleanly invalidates cached
                                corrections.  Pass ``None`` to run
                                without document-level context.  The
                                pipeline never generates a summary on
                                its own — that responsibility lives in
                                the ``/summary/generate`` endpoint, so
                                the user can review / edit before the
                                pipeline runs.

                                  ``{"type": "split_done", "pieces": N}``
                                  ``{"type": "piece_start", "index": i, "total": N}``

                                  Indices are 1-based for UI consumption.
        stop_check:             Optional zero-arg predicate.  When it
                                returns True between piece awaits, the
                                pipeline raises ``InterruptedError`` and
                                cancels in-flight tasks.  The checkpoint
                                survives so a future call resumes work.
        target_chars / max_chars: Forwarded to the splitter.
        rolling_context_chars:  Forwarded to the rolling-context helper.
        concurrency:            Max pieces processed in flight at once.

    Returns:
        A :class:`PipelineResult` containing the reassembled corrected
        markdown plus stats useful for the UI (cache hit count, list of
        pieces that failed).

    Raises:
        InterruptedError:       When ``stop_check`` reported cancellation
                                between awaits.  All in-flight tasks are
                                drained cleanly before the raise.
        ValueError:             For invalid configuration (handled upstream).
