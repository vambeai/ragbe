"""
Per-piece checkpoint store for the markdown enrichment pipeline.

A 400-page enrichment run can make 100+ LLM calls.  Losing all of that work
to a network blip or a process restart is exactly the pain point the VLM
checkpoint pattern was built to solve, and the same shape works here:
persist each piece's corrected output as it succeeds; on the next run,
skip any piece whose input is unchanged.

Differences from :mod:`backend.converters.vlm_checkpoint`:

    * The on-disk record stores BOTH the corrected content AND a content
      hash, so the cache is invalidated automatically when *any* input
      that determines the LLM output changes (piece content, prompt,
      model).  No external manifest to keep in sync.
    * Stored as JSON ``{"hash": "...", "content": "..."}``, not bare
      markdown — the hash keeps every cache hit byte-for-byte correct.

The checkpoint directory lives at ``mds/.checkpoints/{stem}_enrich/`` so
it sits alongside (but cannot collide with) the VLM checkpoint dir for
the same document.

    is included because it directly affects sampling and therefore the
    corrected output.

    or because cleanup/splitting yielded different piece content — every
    downstream piece-correction entry invalidates automatically.  Pass
    the empty string for callers that do not use a document summary;
