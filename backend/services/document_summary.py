"""
Document-level summary store + map-reduce orchestrator.

The summary is the "what is this document about" reference block that gets
attached to every per-piece correction prompt (and every chunk-enrichment
prompt — see Phase B).  Generating it once and caching it keeps the marginal
cost of a re-run negligible: ``topic_hints`` are unioned across pieces in
pure Python, and a single LLM reduce call picks a final ``topic`` and
synthesises a ~200-word ``narrative``.

Storage shape — one JSON sibling **per source PDF** (not per converter),
``mds/{doc_stem}.summary.json``::

    {
        "source_hash": "sha256(<PDF bytes>, or cleaned MD for bare-MD uploads)",
        "summary": {
            "topic":     "<one short phrase>",
            "narrative": "<~200-word paragraph>"
        },
        "generated_at": "2026-05-21T14:22:00Z",
        "user_edited":  false
    }

Per-piece extractions are NOT persisted: a Regenerate rebuilds from
scratch.  The runtime ``PieceExtraction`` dataclass only carries
``topic_hints`` and a one-sentence ``narrative`` — see ``PieceExtraction``
below.  This is intentionally a thinner schema than the original design
notes (no entities / terms / document_type fields); those fields turned
out to be unreliable to extract and were dropped along with their
persistence layer.

Lifecycle:
    * Created on first markdown-enrichment run (via the SummaryReviewModal
      → /api/enrich/summary/generate) or on the first chunk-enrichment
      run that requests it.
    * The summary is keyed by the source PDF itself: ``source_hash`` is
      the SHA-256 of the PDF bytes when one exists on disk (the common
      case), or — when only an uploaded ``.md`` exists — of the cleaned
      markdown.  Switching converters (e.g. running enrichment on the
      Cloud variant after the VLM variant) therefore reuses the cached
      summary without any LLM calls.
    * ``user_edited=True`` makes a stored summary authoritative: future
      runs return it verbatim until an explicit Regenerate, a PDF
      re-upload, or a document delete wipes the file.
    * Cascade-deleted alongside the .md / chunks / checkpoint dirs on PDF
      re-upload and document delete (see ``document_service``).

Map-reduce flow:
    1. Cache check.  Source-hash match AND non-empty summary ⇒ return
       cached, zero LLM calls.  User-edited records short-circuit even
       on hash mismatch unless ``force_regenerate=True``.
    2. Map: extract ``PieceExtraction(topic_hints, narrative)`` from each
       piece in parallel (semaphore bounded by ``concurrency``).  Failed
       extractions yield an empty ``PieceExtraction`` so the reduce step
       still receives the same number of slots.
    3. Reduce — possibly tiered:
         * ``len(extractions) <= REDUCE_TIER_THRESHOLD`` (30): single
           reduce call over all extractions.
         * Otherwise: groups of ``REDUCE_TIER_SIZE`` (10) reduce in
           parallel to ``DocumentSummary`` partials, then a final reduce
           across the partials.  Keeps the reduce prompt within any
           reasonable context window regardless of document length.
       Each ``_reduce_once`` first unions topic hints in pure Python
       (case-insensitive, order-preserving), then asks the LLM for
       final ``topic`` + ``narrative``.  On LLM failure it returns an
       empty summary so the run still completes.
    4. Persist atomically via tmp + ``os.replace``.

Failure handling:
    * Per-piece extraction failure → empty extraction in its slot;
      logged at WARNING.
    * Reduce failure → empty ``{"topic": "", "narrative": ""}`` so the
      downstream pipeline still runs (just without document-level
      context).  Logged at WARNING.
    * Cancellation is checked before every LLM call.

    piece-extraction cache.

    The piece extractions, source hash, generation timestamp, and model
    metadata are carried over from the stored record so a future
    Regenerate can still benefit from the per-piece cache.  Only the
    summary content changes, and ``user_edited`` flips to ``True`` so
    subsequent enrichment runs treat the edit as authoritative.

    If no prior record exists (the user shouldn't reach this path
    because the modal can only save what it loaded, but be defensive)
    we create a fresh record with empty extractions.
