"""
Structure-aware markdown splitter for the enrichment pipeline.

Splits a markdown document into pieces sized for an LLM's context window
while *never* cutting across structurally significant boundaries.  In
practice that means:

    * Never split inside a fenced code block.
    * Never split inside a markdown table.
    * Never split inside a contiguous list group (consecutive list items
      and any nested content immediately under them).
    * Prefer splitting at heading boundaries (H1, then H2, then H3, …) so
      pieces are semantically coherent.
    * Fall back to paragraph (blank-line) boundaries when no heading
      candidate exists in range.
    * Fall back to absolute size cap only when the document has *no* safe
      boundary at all (e.g. one massive paragraph with no headings or
      blank lines).  This is rare and only happens with pathological
      inputs; the LLM will still get a coherent piece, just at the
      configured max.

The result is a list of :class:`Piece` objects, each carrying its slice
of the original text and the byte-offset span it covers.  The offsets let
the pipeline orchestrator compute the "rolling context" — the last N
characters of the *previous original* piece — without rescanning the
source.  Using the original offsets (not corrected text) avoids the drift
that would happen if each piece's correction fed forward into the next.

Performance: single linear pass; produces ~one piece per 4000-6000 chars
of input.  A 400-page document (~1 MB) yields roughly 150-250 pieces and
splits in well under a second.

    Strategy (single linear pass, no inner search):

        Walk the blocks tracking the highest-priority boundary seen since
        the last split (the "best so far").  Boundary priority is:

            4 — heading            (semantic break, strongly preferred)
            3 — blank line         (paragraph break)

        On each block, after accumulating its size into ``running``:

          * If ``running >= target_chars`` and a *heading* boundary is

          * Otherwise if ``running >= max_chars``, force a split at the
            best non-heading boundary seen so far (blank or marker), or
            — if there's no boundary at all — after the current block.
            Forced splits never land inside a structural block because
