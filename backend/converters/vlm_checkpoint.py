"""
Per-page checkpoint store for the VLM converter.

A 400-page VLM job can take hours and burn meaningful API spend.  When a job
is interrupted (network blip, process crash, user disconnect, model failure),
losing every page already transcribed is the dominant pain point of the
current implementation.

This module persists each successfully transcribed page to its own file under
``{MDS_DIR}/.checkpoints/{stem}_vlm/page_NNNN.md``.  On the next run, the VLM
converter consults the store before rendering or calling the model — pages
already on disk are returned verbatim and the API call is skipped entirely.

Design notes:
    * **No manifest / no auto-invalidation.**  The "Resume from checkpoint"
      checkbox in the UI is the sole control.  Stale caches that survive a
      PDF replacement are handled at upload time (the upload service wipes
      the checkpoint directory when overwriting an existing PDF).
    * **Atomic writes via ``os.replace``.**  A crash mid-write cannot leave
      a half-written page file on disk, which would otherwise be loaded as
      truncated Markdown on the next run.
    * **Cheap on disk.**  Each page is a few KB of Markdown; a 400-page job
      consumes ~1-4 MB.  No compression needed.
